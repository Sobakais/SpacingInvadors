## Lore
In the distant future, Eorth faced an unexpected threat from an advanced alien civilization known as the 'Invadors'. These hostile aliens, driven by a desire for conquest and domination, launched a massive invasion force towards our planet. With their powerful warships and deadly weaponry, they quickly overwhelmed Eorth's defenses, laying waste to entire cities.

In a desperate bid for survival, the nations of Eorth pooled their resources to develop a highly advanced spacecraft known as the "Spacing Invador" Equipped with state-of-the-art weapons and shields, the Spacing Invador was Eorth's last hope against the alien menace. Brave pilots from around the world volunteered to pilot these ships and engage the Invaders in a fierce battle for the fate of humanity.

As the sole pilot of the Spacing Invador, you must confront wave after wave of alien attackers, dodging their deadly barrage of firepower and retaliating with your own arsenal of lasers and missiles. The fate of Eorth hangs in the balance as you face off against the relentless onslaught of the Invaders, pushing the limits of your abilities to protect your home planet and drive back the alien invaders once and for all. Will you emerge victorious and save humanity from extinction, or will the Invaders succeed in their sinister plans for domination? The fate of Eorth is in your hands.
